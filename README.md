# DataS_Cleaning_Assignment
Assignment for data scientist course 3 (cleaning and tidying) on Coursera

The R code in this repository follows the five steps in the Assignment requirement to clean up data files of an experiment on wearable computer. 
The input database can be downloaded at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The assignment followed five steps, delineated in Coursera as follow:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Data from step 4 and 5 will be written out as output in two files and were also uploaded onto this repository
1. Step4Data.csv
2. Step5Data.csv
However because Step5Data.csv is too big, the two files could not be uploaded as they are but zipped into Step4_5Data.zip

The new code book for each variable was also uploaded onto this repository which was named: AssignmentCodeBook.txt
